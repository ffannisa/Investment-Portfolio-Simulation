# Investment Portfolio Simulation
### Abstract 
Our project consists of an interactive investment portfolio simulation tool designed to assist 
portfolio managers and wealth accumulation companies in crafting strategic investment 
strategies for their clients. The core of our project revolves around an interactive simulation 
game that emulates the dynamics of real-world investing over a 40-year span. This simulation is 
engineered to cater to different risk profiles, including risk-averse and high-risk takers, thereby 
allowing players to understand and craft tailored investment strategies that align with the 
investor's risk tolerance. It models an agent-based simulation approach, where stock returns 
are the agents, responding to various market events. 
### Motivation 
We were motivated to pursue this project idea by taking up the ESD Course: 40.240 Investment 
Science. We wanted to apply the knowledge learnt in the Investment Science course to real 
world data and simulate the expected returns generated by risk-averse and high-risk portfolio 
allocation strategies. This project is also extremely useful for the wealth management industry as 
the simulation provides insightful results into the differences in returns generated upon 
employing different strategies of asset allocation.
